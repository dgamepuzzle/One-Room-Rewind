Inspired by Brackey's portal in unity, time rewind, and hit game Superhot, combined with inspiration from some of my favorite puzzle games like The Witness, and the Zelda Series.

The game focues on being trapped in one ever-expanding room, with only the power of time on your side.
Fight monsters, solve puzzles, and escape the room, all while rewinding, warping, and freezing time to avoid danger and retrace your steps.
